If you send me a note// telling me how cool you think it UAppleObject is, you may incorporate it into// any product you like (six-packs of good beer are also acceptable, no C.O.D.// shipments, please).  Also, you must keep all copyright and other notices in// the source code, especially MY NAME (The system is called ego-ware™.  Get it?).//// THEORY OF OPERATION//// This unit includes and uses two classes for the processing of AppleEvents,// especially AppleEvents whose targets are objects in the application domain// (ie: object specifiers).  By properly utilizing TAppleObjectDispatcher and// MAppleObject, you should be able to, very easily, add full AppleEvent support// to any well designed object-oriented application.//// MAppleObject represents an encapsulation of the standard AppleEvent object// model.  The various pure virtual methods are the hooks for the AppleEvent// world to be translated into application domain instances.  Thus, the functionality// of MAppleObject is based on managing the translation between Object Model// categories and application domain instances.//// TAppleObjectDispatcher has a very different, yet equally important, function.// Whereas, MAppleObject defines the protocol for inter-object communication at a// very high level, TAppleObjectDispatcher encapsulates the mechanics of translating// the AppleEvent protocol into C++ objects and methods.  It provides a generic// interface for handling AppleEvents and translating AppleEvent object specifiers// into application domain object instances.  TAppleObjectDispatcher is implemented// by wrapping the Object Support Library for the object model-instance translation.//// Subclasses of TAppleObjectDispatcher may be created to add advanced OSL topics// to the melange of object distribution.  Things I’d like to include in future// versions of this product, if any, include support for marking and lists.// Admitedly, what appears here is not the be all end all of object processing;// it’s simply a second approximation proof of concept that this is possible,// with the potential of being exceptionally easy to use and program.#ifndef _UAPPLEOBJECT_#define _UAPPLEOBJECT_#ifndef __APPLEEVENTS__#include <AppleEvents.h>#endifenum{	errAppleObjectDispatcherAlreadyInstalled = 1000,	errAlreadyHaveAnApplication = 1001,	errCantCopyTheApplication = 1002};class TAppleObjectDispatcher;class MAppleObject;class TAppleObjectDispatcher{public:	TAppleObjectDispatcher();	virtual ~TAppleObjectDispatcher();	virtual void Install();	virtual MAppleObject* ExtractObject(const AEDesc& descriptor);	virtual void StuffDescriptor(AEDesc& descriptor, MAppleObject* object);	virtual void HandleAppleEvent(const AppleEvent& message,								  AppleEvent& reply,								  long refCon);	virtual void AccessContainedObjects(DescType desiredClass,										const AEDesc& container,										DescType containerClass,										DescType form,										const AEDesc& selectionData,										AEDesc& value,										long refCon);	virtual long CountObjects(const AEDesc& containerToken,							  DescType countObjectsOfType);	virtual Boolean CompareObjects(DescType operation,								   const AEDesc& obj1,								   const AEDesc& obj2);	virtual void DisposeToken(AEDesc& unneededToken);	virtual MAppleObject* GetTarget(const AppleEvent& message);	virtual void SetTokenObjectDisposal(MAppleObject* tokenObject,									   Boolean needsDisposal);		// In addition to the needsDisposal argument returned from		// GetContainedObject, an application may control the management of an		// object by calling the SetTokenObjectDisposal routine.
