ÊINFINITY WINDOID 3.0Written by Troy Gaul© 1991-95 Infinity SystemsAll rights reserved.DESCRIPTION:This archive contains the source for a standalone code resource that conforms to a Window DEFinition (WDEF), as defined by Apple Computer in Inside Macintosh.		It provides a 'windoid' appearance. A windoid is a floating window that appears above document windows in an application and is commonly used for things like tool palettes, information windows, and the like.The versions of the Windoid WDEF included in the ResEdit files can be used as-is. This WDEF is created for System 6 and later, but it would be easy to modify it for earlier systems if this is important.There are compiler flags available in the code to support the ways in which the THINK languages and MacApp handle their own windoid WDEFs. (These are also included in the Other Styles folder in this archive, so you can just copy them to use in place of the original. Note that the MacApp Style Windoid does not support ALL of the possible variations, but it supports the most common ones (is supports everything except the "large" titlebar with title, and the grow box options).I would like to see this WDEF be used as widely as possible, as I have seen many programs recently that use the old-style black-and-white version. The WDEF should be fairly compatible with the ones included with THINK Pascal and MacApp among others, so it should require a minimum of work to use. Also, I plan to support and upgrade this WDEF as needed, while maintaining its freeware status and including the source code (so it can be modified). I only request any modification of this WDEF be true to its form in terms of graphical design, and that you inform me of any changes (possibly providing source code if you think it might be useful to other Infinity Windoid users).FEATURES:¥  Supports System 7-style coloring of windows.¥  In System 7, the tinge color set by the user in the Color control panel is used.¥  Close box can be enabled from NewWindow by setting goAwayFlag.¥  Zoom box implemented, utilized by adding 4 to the proc ID used to create the windoid.¥  Title bar can appear along the left of the window if 8 is added to the proc ID.¥  For MacApp users, the behavior of the windoid can be switched.¥  DeviceLoop is used so the windoid will be drawn correctly even when it crosses monitors of differing depths.¥  In System 7, indexed monitors' color tables are checked to see if there are enough different colors to display the color version (like the system WDEF).¥	Supports title string in the titlebar.¥	Supports a grow box (add 2 to the procID).¥	Provides a choice between styles of the titlebar (normal or one that looks like the System 7.5 floating window WDEF).	CHANGES IN VERSION 3.0:¥ Added a new variation that makes the Infinity Windoid act exactly like the System 7.5 floating window WDEF.¥ Changed the address information (both e-mail and US mail) to reflect my new location.¥ Added project file for Metrowerks CodeWarrior for PowerPC (also, updated Symantec project file to version 7.0.x).¥ Made the WDEF use NewHandleClear instead of NewHandle so that the Rects for zooming would be zeroed like the System WDEF's are when there is no zoom box.¥ Now requires Universal Headers.¥ When compiling for PowerPC, the drawing routines no longer allocate a small amount of temporary memory in the heap each time they are called.¥ Made zoom box behavior more consistent with the standard System WDEF.¥ A few compiler options have been removed to simplify the code.¥ Reorganized drawing code.For a full history of changes made in this and previous versions, see the enclosed file "Version History" in the Documentation folder.WDEF TESTER:A WDEF Tester application is also included. This application is not yet in final form (and may never be).  Notably, it does not work with System 6 or 68000 Macs yet. Note, however, that the Infinity Windoid WILL work on such systems. The tester does not yet have a documentation file, but its features should be pretty self-explanatory. In order to try out the Infinity Windoid file included with this archive, simply drop it onto the WDEF Tester application. You will then be prompted for paramaters (the WDEF in the file you dropped will be the default). Note also that the default build of the WDEF doesn't include support for a grow box or a title in the titlebar. There are other versions with other features in the Other Versions folder.LEGAL STUFF:Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice appears in all copies (of the source).
