(It just turns on the						previous two flags.)		qMacAppStyle -		This determines if the varcodes that are supported are						the one's I consider 'normal' or the ones MacApp's						windoid WDEF knows about. Note, however, that this code						only supports the “smaller”, title-less version that						is available in MacApp’s.	qThinkStyle -		This creates a version of the WDEF that is totally						compatible with the varcodes used in the windoid WDEF 						included with the THINK environments. 											Two things are done: varcode 0 gives a normal titlebar, 						varcode 2 gives a titlebar down the left side, and other 						varcodes (i.e. 1,3,4,5,6,7) give no titlebar at all. 						Also, for the THINK style, qAlwaysHilite is also set.	OPTION FLAGS:	qApple75Varcodes -	This causes the Infinity Windoid to have the same						behaviors as the System 7.5 floating window WDEF (ID 124)						when the same varcodes are used.	qAllowVert -		This determines if the windoid will support a floater 						that has a vertical title bar along the left side of 						the window.	qAllowGrow -		This option creates a WDEF that supports a grow box. 						This grow box behaves exactly like that of a standard 						document window. This addition to the code was provided 						to me by Jim Petrick.		qAllowZoom -		This option creates a windoid that supports a zoombox.											The application is responsible for setting the user state 						and standard state Rects of the window for zooming. (When 						a new window is created, both of these are initialized to 						the bounds of the window. See the README for more 						information).	qUseGestalt -		Define this if you want to use Gestalt to determine the						System and QuickDraw versions. Otherwise, SysEnvirons is						used. (NOTE: using Gestalt in MPW will cause additional						glue code to be attached to the WDEF resource, making it						larger.)	SystemSevenOrLater -A standard Apple header flag.  If this flag is set, 						a version of the WDEF that doesn't support the System 6 						coloring will be compiled. Note that this version may 						crash on systems earlier than 7.0, so your application 						should make sure to check for System 7 or later.					APPEARANCE MODIFICATION:						qApple75Design -	This causes the Infinity Windoid to assume the 						appearance of the System 7.5 floating window WDEF 						(ID 124).						qSmallGrow -		This option will cause the grow box to be drawn smaller						than the standard size.	qTitleString -		When enabled, the windoid’s title will appear centered  						in the titlebar. 											This feature does not look at the script and change the						size of the titlebar as is recommended for regions with  						an application font that doesn't work at 9 points. 					BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION:	qStayputZoom -		This option will cause both the user and standard Rects 						to be changed together, causing the zoomed in and out 						state to have the same topLeft at all times.  If this is 						not set, the standard and user states have their own 						‘memories’.NO LONGER SUPPORTED:	VERS_2_2_COMPATIBLE -	Removed in 3.0.	DONT_ALIGN_ZOOM -		Removed in 3.0.  	NOT_PBOOK_AWARE -		Removed in 3.0.  The WDEF will now always check  							for a PowerBook’s passive matrix screen like the 							System does.	MFI_ZOOM -				Removed in 3.0.  The application can create this							windoid ‘shrinking’ behavior by setting the zoom							rectangle information in the window’s dataHandle							directly (as described in IM: Toolbox Essentials).	THICK_TITLEBAR - 		Removed in 3.0.  I’ve grown to like this so much 							more than the (original) thin version of the 							titlebar that this is now to only way to compile 							it (i.e. it is always on).								ALWAYS_HILITE -			Removed in 3.0.  This function can be activated							by using an appropriate variation code (subtracting							1 from the constants given in InfinityWindoid.h).		If you depend on any of the above compiler options that are no longer		supported, you can either use a previous version of the WDEF or make		the necessary modifications to this version (none of them were overly		complicated).				Also removed are support for non-universal headers and for System 6		coloring (with Kolor or a similar control panel) -- although System 6		black and white support is still included by default.  These would		probably be more difficult to add back in, so if you want them, you		would be best going back to version 2.6.------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/#define qApple75Style		0#define qApple75Varcodes	1#define qTitleString		1#define qAllowZoom			1#define qAllowGrow			1#define qAllowVert			1#define qStayputZoom		0// —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————////	Combinations//// —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————//		These should pretty much remain untouched.// —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————#if qApple75Style	#undef  qApple75Design	#define qApple75Design		1	#undef  qApple75Varcodes	#define qApple75Varcodes	1	#undef  qAllowZoom	#define qAllowZoom			1		#undef  qAllowGrow	#define qAllowGrow			1	#undef  qAllowVert	#define qAllowVert			1#endif// —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————#if qApple75Design	#undef  qTitleString	#define qTitleString		1#endif// —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————#if qThinkStyle	#undef  qAllowVert	#define qAllowVert			1		#undef  qAlwaysHilite	#define qAlwaysHilite		1	#undef  qMacAppStyle	#define qMacAppStyle		0#endif// —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————#if qMacAppStyle	#undef  qAllowVert	#define qAllowVert			0		#undef  qAlwaysHilite	#define qAlwaysHilite		0	#undef  qAllowGrow	#define qAllowGrow			1#endif// —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————////	System version define//// —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————#define SystemSixOrLater	1	// This is used so that we can cut down on the code size in MPW.
